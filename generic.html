								<h2>Background Information</h2>
								<p>I was born in HoChiMinh city, Vietnam in 2001 with my parents both Vietnamese.
								I grew up wondering a lot things and i used to overthing things and get paranoid easily. But my family, especially my father have helped me get through these trouble times and i will be forever
								greatfull to them. We are not a perfect family, but in my eyes, it's more than enough for me. I also have a pet cat name Meenu and she is very aggressive, but in a good way.
                                I've grown up studying Asia International School, Vietnam and i speak both Vietnamese and English fuluently. Am also very fond of Japanese culture, but my favorite culture is still Vietnamese.</p>
								<p>I love eating pizza, french-fries, fried rice, noodles,... but my favorite food is ice-cream (mainly vanila and strawberry). My hobby is playing video games and making videos, i used 
                                   to make "Youtube content" but now i need to focus more on my life and try my best to repay my parrents for what they have done for me.<p>								
								<h2>How i started to become an I.T lover</h2>
								<p>I first started to use computers when i was 6 years old (2007) it was a "Dell" PC with window Xp which i thought was magic when i first saw it
								   .It was until 2010 that I really started to like to do things on PC such as playing games, browsing the internet, watch videos, using social media,ect.
								   This continuous on until 2014 when i discovered that technology has taken over the world, my hobby was used to play outdoor activities. But in 2015, i became an introvert and spend 
                                    "most" of my days sitting in front of a computer screen.</p>
