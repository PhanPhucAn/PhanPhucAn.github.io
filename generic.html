								<h2>Background Information</h2>
								<p>I was born in HoChiMinh city, Vietnam in 2001.
								I grew up wondering a lot things and i used to overthing things and get paranoid easily. But my family, especially my father have helped me get through these trouble times and i will be forever
								greatfull to them. We are not a perfect family, but in my eyes, it's more than enough for me.</p>
								
								<p>I love eating pizza, french-fries, fried rice, noodles,... but my favorite food is ice-cream (mainly vanila and strawberry). My hobby is playing video games and making videos, i used 
                                   to make "Youtube content" but now i need to focus more on my life and try my best to repay my parrents for what they have done for me.<p>								
								<h2>How i started to become an I.T lover</h2>
								<p>I first started to use computers when i was 6 years old (2007) it was a "Dell" PC with window Xp which i thought was magic when i first saw it
								   .It was until 2010 that really started to like to do things on PC such as playing games, browsing the internet, watch videos, using social media,ect.
								   This continuous on until 2014 when i discovered that technology has taken over the world, my hobby was used to play outdoor activities. But in 2015, i became an introvert and spend 
                                    "most" of my days sitting in front of a computer screen.</p>
